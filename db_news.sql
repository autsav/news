(13, 3, 'UN approves watered-down new sanctions against North Korea', 'The UN Security Council on Monday unanimously approved new sanctions on North Korea but not the toughest-ever measures sought by the Trump administration to ban all oil imports and freeze international assets of the government and its leader, Kim Jong Un.', '<p>The resolution, responding to Pyongyang&rsquo;s sixth and strongest nuclear test explosion on September 3, does ban North Korea from importing all natural gas liquids and condensates. It also bans all textile exports and prohibits any country from authorizing new work permits for North Korean workers &mdash; two key sources of hard currency for the northeast Asian nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for energy, it caps Pyongyang&rsquo;s imports of crude oil at the level of the last 12 months, and it limits the import of refined petroleum products to 2 million barrels a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The watered-down resolution does not include sanctions that the US wanted on North Korea&rsquo;s national airline and the army.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nonetheless, US Ambassador Nikki Haley told the council after the vote that &ldquo;these are by far the strongest measures ever imposed on North Korea.&rdquo; But she stressed that &ldquo;these steps only work if all nations implement them completely and aggressively.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Haley noted that the council was meeting on the 16th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attack. In a clear message to North Korean threats to attack the US, she said: &ldquo;We will never forget the lesson that those who have evil intentions must be confronted.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Today we are saying the world will never accept a nuclear armed North Korea,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We are done trying to prod the regime to do the right thing&rdquo; and instead are taking steps to prevent it &ldquo;from doing the wrong thing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Haley said the US doesn&rsquo;t take pleasure in strengthening sanctions and reiterated that the US does not want war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The North Korean regime has not yet passed the point of no return,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If it agrees to stop its nuclear program it can reclaim its future. If it proves it can live in peace, the world will live in peace with it. &hellip; If North Korea continues its dangerous path, we will continue with further pressure.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final agreement was reached after negotiations between the US and China, the North&rsquo;s ally and major trading partner. Haley said the resolution never would have happened without the &ldquo;strong relationship&rdquo; between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But its provisions are a significant climb-down from the very tough sanctions the Trump administration proposed last Tuesday, especially on oil, where a complete ban could have crippled North Korea&rsquo;s economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cap on the import of petroleum products could have an impact, but North Korea will still be able to import the same amount of crude oil that is has this year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the US Energy Information Administration, China supplies most of North Korea&rsquo;s crude oil imports, which a US official put at 4 million barrels a year. The agency cited UN customs data showing that China reported sending 6,000 barrels a day of oil products to North Korea, which it said is mostly gasoline and diesel fuel vital to the country&rsquo;s agriculture, transportation and military sectors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That would mean North Korea imports nearly 2.2 million barrels a year in petroleum products, so the 2 million barrel cap in the resolution would represent a 10 percent cut. But the US official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said North Korea now receives about 4.5 million barrels of refined petroleum products, which would mean a more than 50 percent cut.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The textile ban is significant. Textiles are North Korea&rsquo;s main source of export revenue after coal, iron, seafood and other minerals that have already been severely restricted by previous UN resolutions. North Korean textile exports in 2016 totaled $752.5 million, accounting for about one-fourth of its total $3 billion in merchandise exports, according to South Korean government figures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Haley said the Trump administration believes the new sanctions combined with previous measures would ban over 90 percent of North Korea&rsquo;s exports reported in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for North Koreans working overseas, the US Mission said a cutoff on new work permits will eventually cost North Korea about $500 million a year once current work permits expire. The US estimates about 93,000 North Koreans are currently working abroad, the US official said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original US draft would have ordered all countries to impose an asset freeze and travel ban on Kim Jong Un and four other top party and government officials. The resolution adopted Monday adds only one person to the sanctions list &mdash; Pak Yong Sik, a member of the Workers&rsquo; Party of Korea Central Military Commission, which controls the country&rsquo;s military and helps direct its military industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original US draft would also have frozen the assets of North Korea&rsquo;s state-owned airline Air Koryo, the Korean People&rsquo;s Army and five other powerful military and party entities. The resolution adds only the Central Military Commission of the Workers&rsquo; Party of Korea and the party&rsquo;s powerful Organization and Guidance Department and its Propaganda and Agitation Department to the sanctions blacklist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>North Korea&rsquo;s Foreign Ministry issued a statement early Monday saying it was watching the United States&rsquo; moves closely and warned that it was &ldquo;ready and willing&rdquo; to respond with measures of its own. It said the US would pay a heavy price if the sanctions proposed by Washington are adopted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Britain&rsquo;s UN ambassador, Matthew Rycroft, told reporters who questioned the watering down of the initial US text that &ldquo;there is a significant prize in keeping the whole of the Security Council united.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rycroft called the resolution &ldquo;a very significant set of additional sanctions,&rdquo; declaring that &ldquo;we are tightening the screw, and we stand prepared to tighten it further.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>French Ambassador Francois Delattre said, &ldquo;We are facing not a regional but a global threat, not a virtual but an immediate threat, not a serious but an existential threat.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Make no mistake about it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;our firmness today is our best antidote to the risk of war, to the risk of confrontation, and our firmness today is our best tool for a political solution tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China and Russia had called for a resolution focused on a political solution to the escalating crisis over North Koreas nuclear program. They have proposed a freeze-for-freeze that would halt North Korean nuclear and missile tests in exchange for the US and South Korea stopping their joint military exercises &mdash; but the Trump administration has rejected that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China&rsquo;s UN ambassador, Liu Jieyi, said Beijing has been making &ldquo;unremitting efforts&rdquo; to denuclearize and maintain peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Liu again urged the council to adopt the freeze-for-freeze proposal and said talks with North Korea are needed &ldquo;sooner rather than later.&rdquo; He expressed hope that the United States will pledge not to seek regime change or North Korea&rsquo;s collapse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia went further, making clear that while Russia supported the resolution, it wasn&rsquo;t entirely satisfied with the council&rsquo;s approach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He said the &ldquo;unwillingness&rdquo; of the US to reaffirm pledges not to seek regime change or war in North Korea or to include the idea of having UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres use his good offices to try to resolve the dispute &ldquo;gives rise to very serious questions in our minds.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re convinced that diverting the gathering menace from the Korean Peninsula could be done not through further and further sanctions, but by political means,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The resolution does add new language urging &ldquo;further work to reduce tensions so as to advance the prospects for a comprehensive settlement.&rdquo; It retains language reaffirming support for long-stalled six-party talks with that goal involving North Korea, the US, Russia, China, Japan and South Korea.</p>\r\n', '59b75c3b00d5dNorth-Korea-missile-UN.jpg', 1, 1, 1, 'admin', NULL, '2017-09-12 06:02:03', NULL),

But the drug, anacetrapib, only reduced those complications by 9 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now Merck, which has spent 13 years and likely hundreds of millions of dollars testing the drug, has to decide whether to spend even more to seek approval from regulators and convince people to buy it in a market full of cholesterol drugs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The results of the 30,450-patient study were announced Tuesday at a conference of heart specialists in Barcelona, Spain and published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study found that anacetrapib is safe and somewhat effective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That kind of result is normally enough to seek approval to market a new medicine, especially for heart disease, which is the top killer in many developed countries. Yet even after seeing the results weeks ago, Merck says its executives are still consulting with medical experts and regulators on whether to go through the costly process of applying for approval.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Analyst Steve Brozak, president of WBB Securities, predicts Merck will do so, given anacetrapib&rsquo;s safety, the huge pool of potential patients and all the resources Merck has poured into the drug.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This will get used,&rdquo; Brozak said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Merck would likely price the bill somewhere between the two extremes that now define the market for cholesterol drugs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Generic versions of brand-name statin cholesterol pills including Lipitor, Crestor and Merck&rsquo;s own Zocor now cost $10 to $20 a month. Repatha and Praluent, two new injected medicines in a different drug category that have been shown to dramatically reduce cholesterol, cost $14,000 a year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Georgetown University cardiologist Dr. Allen J. Taylor said he thinks the drug would be approved by the Food and Drug Administration despite its &ldquo;relatively weak benefit.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;If you were discussing this with patients,&rdquo; Taylor said, &ldquo;you would have to tell them that when you start this, you&rsquo;ll have to take it for four years to have a 1 percent chance of preventing an event,&rdquo; meaning a heart attack or a procedure such as bypass surgery or implanting a stent to keep an artery open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taylor said it&rsquo;s still unclear how anacetrapib controls cholesterol, which would make it hard for doctors to determine which patients would benefit much from it. But he and Brozak praised the company for doing such an exhaustive, expensive study in an era when many studies are quick and relatively small, sometimes producing unclear results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the study, patients getting anacetrapib plus a statin for four years had, on average, lower levels of bad cholesterol and other fats, and higher levels of good cholesterol, compared to a group getting a statin and a dummy pill. But Merck&rsquo;s drug didn&rsquo;t prevent any deaths from heart attacks or other cardiac problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anacetrapib&rsquo;s only worrisome side effect was a long-term accumulation of the drug in patients&rsquo; fatty tissue.

They have received a huge support from their immediate circle &mdash; parents, friends and teachers &mdash; in this matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;My family says that I am working at a young age and that they are really proud of me,&rdquo; shares Susan Tachamo of Khwopa College. &ldquo;My family tells me to take care of my health and not to worry about family matters,&rdquo; adds Tachamo, a BBS IVth Year student who has been working as a full time computer teacher for the past one year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for Subba &ldquo;teachers are very supportive; whenever I miss any class, they even guide me during break times&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dhital shares, &ldquo;My parents have created a good environment for me at home. They do not let me do household chores, instead they tell me to concentrate on my studies. My friends also share the notes of the classes I have missed.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for Neetu Basnet she says she has a supportive environment in her workplace. According to her, she gets leaves from her office whenever needed, so it is easy for her to prepare for and during exams. She is a IIIrd Semester student of Child Development and Gender Socialisation at Padmakanya Multiple Campus, Bagbazar, and has been working as a cashier at an organization in Putalisadak for the last three years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://1hu9t72zwflj44abyp2h0pfe-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Work-life-balance.jpg\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://1hu9t72zwflj44abyp2h0pfe-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Work-life-balance.jpg\" style=\"height:316px; width:500px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Source: m.piottawa.ca</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>What counts as motivation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>These individuals are being able to balance their studies and work as they find motivation in gaining experience and becoming self-dependent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tachamo says that he is gaining experience as a computer teacher, it may be easy for him to get job related to this field in future too. Besides this, &ldquo;we can earn some money too and can even give to our family,&rdquo; he further says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It is a wonderful feeling to pay our college fees with our own income,&rdquo; says Balla.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Basnet shares that due to her job, she does not get enough time to revise her daily lessons at times. This makes her feel sad, but as the job gives a kind of satisfaction, she has been managing till now.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p><strong>The role of college</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help working students in their endeavour, some colleges in Kathmandu Valley have made special arrangements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bhaktapur&rsquo;s Khwopa College has scheduled Master&rsquo;s level classes till 9:00 am only so that working students are able reach work on time. &ldquo;Bachelor&rsquo;s level classes are till 10:30 am, but we have arranged identity cards for students, who leave at 9:45 am,&rdquo; informs Vice-Principal Rajesh Kumar Shrestha. This card is given only after students provide their work document, and the college also reaches an agreement with the parents regarding the matter, Shrestha adds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;If students are holding jobs related to their studies, it is easier for them as they are learning by doing,&rdquo; opines Bharat Dhungel, Business Communications teacher at the college.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Caspian Valley College, Lalitpur has managed job section classes for the students who are working full time. There are a total of eight job section classes for Bachelor&rsquo;s level students scheduled from 6:00 to 9:00 am, and the daily course of studies is covered within these three hours, says Chairman Gobind Khanal.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>A version of this article appears in print on August 09, 2017 of The Himalayan Times.</p>\r\n', '59c70adb312b2_Businesswoman.jpg', 1, 0, 1, 'admin', 'admin', '2017-09-13 19:55:42', '2017-09-24 03:31:07'),
